<a href="http://turbgate.engin.umich.edu/symposium/index21.html">UMich Symposium on Model-Consistent Data-driven Turbulence Modeling (2021)</a>. 
It was also held in honor of Philippe R. Spalart's contributions to the turbulence modeling field.
Hence, it is sometimes referred to by the moniker "PRS2022".

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p>The symposium was IN-PERSON only, and had two themes:
<ol>
  <li>Identification of critical issues for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, 
      as well as possible ways forward
  <li>A "Collaborative Testing Challenge" for data-driven RANS models
</ol>

<p>The goals of the first theme were to discuss turbulence modeling from both academic and industrial perspectives; 
new developments in RANS, including advancements enabled by data-driven techniques; 
synergies between turbulence theory, traditional modeling, experiments, simulations, and emergent 
ideas; limitations and perceived stagnation of turbulence models; and the latest developments in turbulence scale-resolving simulation capabilities.
Some time was also dedicated to the discussion of transition modeling.

<p>The goal of the second theme was to foster shared understanding of the needs of data-driven model developers, traditional CFD developers and 
especially end users.  Details regarding the Collaborative Testing Challenge can be found below.

<p>Participants could choose to give a presentation on a subject related to the goals of the symposium, to participate in the 
Collaborative Testing Challenge, or both.  Talks (including presentation material) were required in both cases.
<!--Depending upon the number of written papers submitted, we may bring out a special issue of a peer-reviewed journal.-->

<p>Like the symposium held in Ann Arbor in 2017, this one included several invited speakers, and prioritized adequate time for 
formal and informal discussions.

<p><!--<u>There is no registration fee, but there is a mandatory nominal charge of $10 per day
to cover refreshments.</u>  For those who want a boxed lunch provided, there will be an additional
fee of $10 per lunch.  These fees will be collected (in cash) at the symposium.
An optional no-host dinner to honor Philippe Spalart is being held the first evening.-->
This was an open symposium, with no proprietary information presented.
<!--You do <i>not</i> have to give a talk in order to attend.-->

International Airport (both 30+ minute drive from the venue).  Richmond VA is about
1-1.5 hour drive away, and Washington DC is a 3-3.5 hour drive away.

<p><strong><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 700; font-size: x-large">Collaborative Testing Challenge for 
Data-Driven Turbulence Models</strong>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
A key part of this symposium is a friendly turbulence model testing challenge, intended to assess the potential of <u>data-driven 
improvements</u> to turbulence models.
<ul>
  <li><u>Goals</u>: (1) Quantify the impact of recent
      data-driven developments for RANS turbulence models for flows relevant to aerospace CFD;
      (2) Foster shared understanding of turbulence modeling challenges and
      needs between the data-driven model developers and the end users.
  <li><u>Ground Rules</u>:  Each participant to apply their best turbulence model scheme (framework) derived from a data-driven (or other) 
      approach to a range of flows specified by the conference organizers.
</ul>

<p>Note that the term "data-driven" is used loosely.  The derivation of any new model being used for
these cases can involve machine learning, the human brain, or both.
Either compressible or incompressible CFD solvers can be used.
The intent here is <i>not</i> to apply standard turbulence models from the literature, but rather to explore capabilities of data-driven
enhancements.
To be a valid entry, the same turbulence model must be applied to each of the following cases (use the same grids employed for
the results shown on the TMR website if possible):
<ul>
  <li><a href="flatplate_val.html">2DZP: 2D Zero Pressure Gradient Flat Plate Validation Case</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Show (1) Cf vs. x and (2) u+ vs. log(y+) at x=0.97; compare with theory
    </ul>
  <li><a href="channelflow_val.html">2DFDC: 2D Fully-Developed Channel Flow at High Reynolds Number Validation Case</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Show u+ vs. log(y+) at x=500; compare with theory
    </ul>
  <li><a href="jetsubsonic_val.html">ASJ: Axisymmetric Subsonic Jet</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Show (1) u/Ujet vs. x/Djet, (2) u/Ujet vs. y/Djet at 5 specified stations, and (3) u'v'/(Ujet^2) vs. y/Djet at 5 specified stations;
          compare with experiment
    </ul>
  <li><a href="nasahump_val.html">2DWMH: 2D NASA Wall-Mounted Hump Separated Flow Validation Case</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Show (1) Cp vs. x/c, (2) Cf vs. x/c, (3) u/Uinf vs. y/c at 7 specified stations, and (4) u'v'/(Uinf^2) vs. y/c at 7 specified stations;
          compare with experiment
    </ul>
  <li><a href="naca0012_val.html">2DN00: 2D NACA 0012 Airfoil Validation Cases (4 separate cases)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Angles of attack = 10, 15, 17, and 18 deg.
      <li>Show (1) CL vs. alpha, (2) CD vs. CL, (3) Cp vs. x/c, and (4) Cf (upper surface) vs. x/c;
          compare with experiment (except for Cf)
    </ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Prior to the event</b>, the participants of the Collaborative Testing Challenge must send in their results.
<b>See <a href="turb-prs2022-collabdataforms.html">Collaborative Testing Challenge Data Forms</a> page.</b>
This is for the possibility of independent analysis by the Symposium organizers either before or
after the event.

<p><b>At the event</b>, the participants of the Collaborative Testing Challenge will:
<ul>
  <li>Present their own results for all specified test cases, using the same model for each case
  <li>Describe their model, including development process and challenges
  <li>Discuss cost and implementation issues (e.g., what interface would be needed for implementation by others)
</ul>

<p><u>Requirement</u>: the turbulence model (equations, neural network, or other) must be completely open, and
participants must, if requested, agree to submit it to the organizers in some appropriate way 
(e.g., via equations, subroutine, or whatever makes sense), with the goal of possible implementation by someone
other than the originator of the model.
