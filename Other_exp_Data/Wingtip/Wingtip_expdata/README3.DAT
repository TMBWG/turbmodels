There are 24 "QPLOT" blocks of surface pressure data in the file 'CHORDQPL.DAT'.
Each block is preceded by a header block.  The actual data block consists of 
4 columns of data:

Column #1:  Surface Pressure Tap Row Number (these rows run chordwise).
Column #2:  X/c of the individual pressure tap.  
            'X' starts at the L.E. of the wing section.
Column #3:  Y/c of the individual pressure tap...
            really not needed if you already know that the
            section is 0012.
Column #4:  Cp

The coordinate system here 
(which is different from the one used to describe the probe measurements) 
is a wing-fixed system whose origin lies at the leading-edge/root of the wing.
X goes chordwise, Y is 'up', and Z is spanwise.  

The  'Z' location of the data blocks is as follows:

Data Block #          Z (inches)               			Theta (deg)
	1		6, lower wing surface		
	2		6, upper wing surface
	3		12, lower wing surface		
	4		12, upper wing surface
	5		24, lower wing surface		
	6		24, upper wing surface
	7		28, lower wing surface		
	8		28, upper wing surface
	9		30, lower wing surface		
	10		30, upper wing surface
	11		31, lower wing surface		
	12		31, upper wing surface
	13		32, lower wing surface		
	14		32, upper wing surface
	15						10, lower wing half
	16						10, upper wing half
	17						22.5, lower wing half	
	18						22.5, upper wing half
	19						45, lower wing half
	20						45, upper wing half
	21						67.5, lower wing half
	22						67.5,  upper wing half
	23						90.0, lower wing half
	24						90.0, upper wing half 
                                                 (nominally same as block #23)

The 'Theta' describes the wingtip region
...at Theta = 0 degrees we are at the edge of the 
   constant chord section of the wing (Z = 33.12 inches)
...at Theta = 90 degrees we are at the edge of the wingtip.
