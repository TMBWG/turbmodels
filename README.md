# turbmodels
The objective of this site is to provide a resource for CFD developers to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on widely-used Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models, and verify that models are implemented correctly.

This is a public access version of what was originally created by and known as the NASA Langley Research Center Turbulence Modeling Resource.
