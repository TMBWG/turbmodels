# Measured widths and lengths (with uncertainties) of the corner-flow separation
# for the symmetric wing with leading-edge extension (port side)
#
#  alpha(deg) = model angle of incidence (deg)
#  w(mm)      = separation width (mm)
#  U_w(mm)    = estimated uncertainty in width (mm)
#  l(mm)      = separation length (mm)
#  U_l(mm)    = estimated uncertainty in length (mm)
#
# Note: Length l is along wing surface in streamwise direction
#       Width w is along wing surface in spanwise direction
#       (see fig 15(c) in AIAA-2019-0077)
