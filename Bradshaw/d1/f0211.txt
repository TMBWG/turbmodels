 1. FLOW TITLE: CASE 0211;  BRADSHAW, P, HANCOCK, P. E., "EFFECT OF
    FREE STREAM TURBULENCE".

 2. REVISION DATE: NOVEMBER 18, 1980

 3. EVALUATOR: BRADSHAW, P., IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY, LONDON,
    SW7 2BY, ENGLAND.

 4. EXPERIMENT LOCATION AND DATE: IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY,
    LONDON, ENGLAND       1975 - 1978

 5. ABSTRACT: TEST CASE CONSISTS OF THE CORRELATION OF THE
    FRACTIONAL CHANGE IN THE SKIN FRICTION COEFFICIENT, CF, WITH
    A VARIABLE  (UP/UE)*(L/DELTA995+2).  UP IS THE RMS STREAMWISE
    COMPONENT INTENSITY (UP = SQRT(U1U1)), MEASURED AT A NORMAL
    DISTANCE, Y, GREATER THAN 2*L, WHERE L IS A CHARACTERISTIC
    LENGTH SCALE.

    MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE FOR A GIVEN VALUE OF REYNOLDS NUMBER
    BASED ON THETA (RTHETA).  REYNOLDS NUMBER EFFECTS SEEM TO BE
    SMALL FOR RTHETA ABOVE 2000.

    IN THE HANCOCK EXPERIMENT FLUCTUATING SIGNALS WERE DIGITIZED FOR
    OFF-LINE ANALYSIS.  SQUARE BAR BIPLANAR TURBULENCE GENERATING
    GRIDS WITH MESH LENGTHS FROM 0.076 M TO 0.152 M AND VARIOUS
    OPEN AREA RATIOS WERE USED.  ALL THE DATA POINTS ARE FOR
    CONSTANT PRESSURE BOUNDARY LAYERS BELOW GRID TURBULENCE.  PREVIOUSLY,
    IN MANY CASES ONLY UP WAS MEASURED AND, AFTER ESTIMATING THE
    DISSIPATION (EPSILON) FROM THE DECAY RATE, THE LENGTH SCALE, L,
    WAS DEFINED FROM
                 -UP**3 / L = -2*EPSILON / 3  = UE* DU1U1/DX
    IN OBTAINING THIS RELATION IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED THAT MEAN-SQUARE
    INTENSITIES IN THE FREE STREAM ARE RELATED BY
                          V1V1 = W1W1 = 0.8 * U1U1.

    THUS BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR CALCULATIONS MUST SIMULATE DECAY OF
    UP.  IF NOT CALCULATED TAKE UP TO VARY AS X**(-.6), L AS X**(0.4)
    RANGE, UP .LE. 0.05*UE AND 0.5 < L/DELTA995 < 4.0

    DATA EVALUATION ASSUMES ACCURACY OF THE LOGARITHMIC LAW.  THUS
    THE CF CORRELATION IMPLIES A CORRELATION FOR THE WAKE PARAMETER
    PI (BEST DEFINED AS THE WAKE STRENGTH AT Y = DELTA995, SINCE
    COLES' COSINE WAKE IS A POOR FIT AT HIGH FREE-STREAM TURBULENCE).

    START CALCULATIONS WITH STANDARD CONSTANT PRESSURE PROFILES,
    FOR SIMPLICITY, AND HIGH FREE STREAM UP.  RUN THEN DESCRIBES A
    TRAJECTORY IN THE UP, L/DELTA995 PLANE AND CF PREDICTIONS CAN
    BE PLOTTED ON THE (UP/UE)*(L/DELTA995+2) VERSUS (CF-CFO)/CFO
    CORRELATION PLANE, IGNORING THE EARLY PART OF THE RUN WHERE THE
    PROFILES ARE MISMATCHED.  CFO IS THE ZERO FREE-STREAM TURBULENCE
    VALUE OF CF.  CHOOSE INITIAL RTHETA AS AT LEAST 2000.

 7. INSTRUMENTATION:
    MEAN VELOCITY: (HANCOCK EXPERIMENT) PITOT TUBE.
    SKIN FRICTION: PRESTON TUBE.
    TURBULENCE: DISA 55D01 CONSTANT TEMPERATURE BRIDGES OPERATING
    DISA 55P51 CROSS WIRE PROBES WITH PLATINUM WIRES (5E-6 M IN
    DIAMETER, 1E-3 M IN LENGTH).

 8. EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS:
    WIND TUNNEL DIMENSIONS: ......................  0.91 M X 0.91 M
    REFERENCE FREE STREAM VELOCITY (UREF): .......  15 M/S
    FREE-STREAM TURBULENCE LEVEL(WITHOUT GRIDS):   <0.0003
    FLAT PLATE CHORD: ............................  2.5 M
    FLAT PLATE SPAN: .............................  0.91 M

 9. MEASURED VARIABLES:  EXTENSIVE TURBULENCE DATA, INCLUDING
    VELOCITY EXTERNAL TO THE BOUNDARY LAYER (UE)
    STREAMWISE COMPONENT RMS INTENSITY (UP)
    WALL SHEAR STRESS (TW)

    THE DATA ARE REPORTED AS A TABLE OF VALUES OF (CF - CFO)/CFO
    CORRESPONDING TO VALUES OF THE VARIABLE
    (UP/UE)*(L/DELTA995 + 2)

10. UNCERTAINTY:
    U/UE : .....................  <0.01 IN DATA
    SHEAR STRESS: /RHO*UE**2....   0.02 (ABSOLUTE), 0.01 (RELATIVE)

11. TAPE ORGANIZATION: THE TAPE IS A 2400 FOOT, 9 TRACK, PHASE ENCO
    DED, ODD PARITY, UNLABELLED TAPE WRITTEN AT A DENSITY OF 1600 BITS
    PER INCH ACCORDING TO EBCDIC CODE.  THE RECORD FORMAT IS FIXED AND
    BLOCKED; RECORD LENGTH = 80 BYTES; BLOCKSIZE = 8000 BYTES

    NORMALIZED DATA ARE CREATED FROM MEASURED DATA AS FOLLOWS:
    XNORM = (X - XMIN)/(XMAX - XMIN)
    NORMALIZED VALUES ARE INTEGERIZED BY MULTIPLYING BY 10000 AND
    ROUNDING UP OR DOWN TO THE NEAREST INTEGER.
    IXNORM = XNORM * 10000.
    THUS EACH NORMALIZED DATUM IS WRITTEN ONTO TAPE AS AN INTEGER
    VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 10000.
    ALL NULL DATA ARE WRITTEN AS 20000
    THE EQUATION DESCRIBING THE RELATION BETWEEN ACTUAL DATA AND
    THE NORMALIZED DATA ON TAPE IS
    X = XMIN + (((XMAX - XMIN) * IXNORM)/10000.)
    WHERE X, XMAX AND XMIN ARE REAL AND IXNORM IS INTEGER.
