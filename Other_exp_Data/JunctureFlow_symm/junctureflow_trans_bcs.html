This page provides information from the Juncture Flow test
to help users determine appropriate boundary conditions for CFD runs.
The most important information for running CFD is listed under "GENERAL" below.
Some of the other data are not strictly boundary conditions, but
rather may be useful for checking aspects of the CFD methodology.

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
The following limited information about wind tunnel inflow characterization is provided:
turbulence level, wall boundary layer thickness, and "other" (total pressure and flow angularity).
Note that collecting inflow conditions is particularly difficult during a model entry in a major
wind tunnel like the 14x22, so some of this was
done in separate tests; analysis of much of it is still ongoing.
The effects of including realistic nonuniform inflow conditions in a CFD in-tunnel
run are not yet known on the quantities of interest for this case.

<u>GENERAL</u>
<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
As described on the
<a href="junctureflow_trans_exp.html">Exp: NASA Juncture Flow - Intro Page for Transitional Symmetric Wing</a>,
for the purpose of maintaining some consistency between input parameters for nondimensional CFD codes, 
the nominal M and T were chosen to be the same between the F6 and symmetric wing because they were both 
well within the ranges experienced during each test.
The nominal conditions were:
<ul>
  <li><b>Re=2.4 million</b> based on crank chord of 580.716 mm (variation in Re was +-0.30% in the transition part of Test 662).
  <li><b>M=0.189</b> (at median dynamic pressure run); (range was 0.174 to 0.192 in the transition part of Test 662).
  <li><b>T=288.84 K</b> (at median dynamic pressure run); (range was 282 to 300 K in the transition part of Test 662).
  <li>Nominal model incidence angles (deg) in tunnel (for the IR data) ranged from -10 to 10 (+-0.02)
    in 2.5-deg increments, from -10 to 10 (+-0.02) in 1-deg increments, and -6 to -2 (+-0.02) in 0.25-deg increments.
  <li>Nominal model incidence angles (deg) in tunnel (for the Cp data used to determine transition location) ranged from -2 to 8 (+-0.02) in 1-deg increments.
</ul>
See notes on the
<a href="junctureflow_trans_geometry.html">Exp: NASA Juncture Flow - Transitional Symmetric Wing Geometry)</a> page
for discussions regarding angle-of-attack corrections, aeroelasticity, and model adherence to
as-designed shape.  Strictly speaking, running a CFD model in tunnel should best represent
the experiment, but the effect on many quantities of interest (QoI) may be relatively minor.

<p>For the transition experiments, the wings were not tripped, but the fuselage nose was tripped for part
of the test.  Description of the fuselage nose tripping can be found 
<!--in 
<a href="../JunctureFlow/Papers/NASA-TM-2019-220286-Kegerise-Neuhart-JF.pdf">NASA/TM-2019-220286</a>
as well as-->
in the notes on the
<a href="junctureflow_trans_geometry.html">Exp: NASA Juncture Flow - Transitional Symmetric Wing Geometry)</a> page.
It is important to note 
that the inboard-most portion of the wing (extending 
roughly 25 mm away from the fuselage)
is located within the fuselage's turbulent boundary layer.  Information about the
boundary layer on the leading edge extension (horn) is detailed in the following document:
<a href="transition_on_LEX.pdf">Slides Describing T662 IR Results</a> (pdf file).
<!--Further outboard, however, 
the boundary layer on the horn and wing leading edge is laminar up to the trip dots, 
as evidenced by infrared images acquired on the upper wing surface.
Additional details are provided in the following document for earlier tests on the F6-based wing:
<a href="../JunctureFlow/T653_IR_results.pdf">Slides Describing T653 IR Results</a> (pdf file).-->

<p>The 14x22 wind tunnel is controlled by measuring total pressure, static pressure (actually delta p
between the total and the static), stagnation temperature,
and dewpoint at specific locations in the tunnel and applying calibration equations.  Details can
be found in

<u>MODEL NOSE REGION</u>

Extensive flowfield data in the model nose region (near x=1168 mm), well

<u>TUNNEL INFLOW TURBULENCE LEVEL</u>
<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
Tunnel inflow turbulence was not measured during this test.  However, it was measured previously,
as reported in 
<a href="../JunctureFlow/Papers/nasa-tp-2004-213247-neuhart-14x22freestream.pdf">NASA/TP-2004-213247</a>.  
Using the results from that report, the presumed 
<b>freestream turbulence intensity for this test is approximately 0.07% - 0.08%</b>.

<u>TUNNEL WALL INCOMING BOUNDARY LAYER THICKNESS</u>
<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
Using wall rake data from this test, the 14x22 wall boundary layer thickness measured upstream of
the model (behind the start of the test section, away from the corners) was consistent on the
top and both side walls.  These measures were also consistent with measurements for the earlier F6-based wing
as well as with earlier unpublished
measurements of the boundary layer on the floor.  Therefore, it can be assumed that <b>the tunnel 
wall boundary layers were roughly 4 - 5 inches (100 - 125 mm) thick at 5 - 6 feet (1.5 - 1.8 m) 
behind the start of the test section for the JF test.</b> The following slides provide details from
the F6-based wing testing:

<a href="../JunctureFlow/rumsey-wallrakes-4.pdf">Slides Describing Tunnel Wall Rake Data</a> (pdf file)
<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
These data are consistent with previously-measured 14x22 wall boundary layer thickness
(<a href="https://github.com/TMBWG/turbmodels/blob/main/Other_exp_Data/JunctureFlow/14x22_Boundary_Layer_Summary.pdf.gz">14x22_Boundary_Layer_Summary.pdf.gz (gzipped)</a>).  Note
the previous measurements also included the effect of the Boundary Layer Removal
System (BLRS) on the bottom wall. The BLRS was <u>not</u> used in the JF test.
