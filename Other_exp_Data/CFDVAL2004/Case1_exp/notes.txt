Some informal experimentalist's notes concerning Case 1:

1) The PIV and hot-wire data were taken with different actuators
(over time, the first actuator failed and needed to be replaced);
the pressure signatures in the actuator cavity, however, were very
similar.

2) The PIV data may have problems close to the surface due to the 
acceleration of the particles.

3) The hot-wire has several problems with this flowfield.  Close to 
the jet exit the hot-wire data has unknown errors because of 
non-linearities arising from the high fluctuation level.  The 
temperature differences between the hot-wire calibration and the jet 
flow may not be accounted for completely, although an attempt was 
made to measure the fluctuating temperature of the jet.  Also, the 
PIV data suggest that the jet may be moving back and forth so the 
hot-wire may not always be acquiring data on the precise centerline 
of the jet.
