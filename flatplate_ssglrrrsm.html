<p><strong><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 700; font-size: x-large">SSG/LRR-RSM-w2012 Expected Results - 2D Zero
Pressure Gradient Flat Plate</strong>

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">Results are shown here from 2 compressible codes
so that the user may compare their own compressible code results.  Multiple grids were
used so the user can see trends with grid refinement.  Different codes will behave
differently with grid refinement depending on many factors (including code order of accuracy
and other numerics),
but it would be expected that as the grid is refined the results
will tend toward an "infinite grid" solution that is the same.
Be careful when comparing details: any differences in boundary conditions or flow conditions
may affect results.

<p>Two independent compressible RANS codes,
CFL3D and TAU, were used to compute this
zero-pressure-gradient flat plate flow with the SSG/LRR-RSM-w2012 second-moment Reynolds stress transport model
(see full description on
<a href="rsm-ssglrr.html">SSG/LRR Full Reynolds Stress Model page</a>). The full series of 5 grids were used.
CFL3D is a cell-centered structured-grid code (NASA Langley), and TAU
is a node-centered unstructured-grid code (DLR).
CFL3D used Roe's Flux Difference
Splitting, whereas TAU was run using central discretization with artificial matrix dissipation 
for the mean flow equations and upwinding for the turbulence equations. Additionally in TAU,
low Mach number preconditioning was applied.
Both codes were run with
full Navier-Stokes,
and both codes used first-order upwinding for the advective terms of the turbulence model.
(However, TAU was also run with second-order upwinding of the turbulence model, 
and it made only minor differences; see near bottom of this page.)
Details about the codes can be found on their respective websites
(<a href="https://nasa.github.io/CFL3D">CFL3D</a>,
<a href="http://tau.dlr.de/code-description">TAU</a>).
The codes were not necessarily run to machine-zero iterative convergence, but an attempt was made to converge
sufficiently so that results of interest were well within normal engineering tolerance and
plotting accuracy.  For example, for CFL3D the density residual was typically
driven down below 10<sup>-13</sup>.  It should be kept in mind that many of the files given below
contain computed values directly from the codes,
using a precision <strong>greater</strong> than the convergence tolerance (i.e., the values
in the files are not necessarily as precise as the number of digits given).

<p>For the CFL3D tests reported below, the turbulent inflow boundary conditions used for SSG/LRR-RSM-w2012
were the following:
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="\hat R_{11, farfield} = \hat R_{22, farfield} = \hat R_{33, farfield} = 6 \times 10^{-9} a_{\infty}^2"
  src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img2.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>(meaning that <img class="tex" alt="k_{farfield} = (\overline{u_1''u_1''} + \overline{u_2''u_2''} + \overline{u_3''u_3''})/2
   = 9 \times 10^{-9} a_{\infty}^2" src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img3.png" />), 
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="\hat R_{12, farfield} = \hat R_{13, farfield} = \hat R_{23, farfield} = 0"
  src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img4.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>and
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="\omega_{farfield} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\rho_{\infty}a_{\infty}^2}{\mu_{\infty}}"
  src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img5.png" /></dd>
</dl>

<p>The above equations represent the "standard" SSG/LRR-RSM-w2012 boundary condition
values used by CFL3D.  In terms of freestream turbulence intensity (Tu) and freestream eddy viscosity, these
boundary conditions for this particular problem (with M=0.2) correspond to:
Tu=0.039% and <img class="tex" alt="\mu_t / \mu = 0.009" src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img7.png" />.

The freestream values used by TAU were
Tu=0.1% and <img class="tex" alt="\mu_t / \mu = 0.1" src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img8.png" />.

For freestream BCs, both codes assume isotropic turbulence conditions (identical normal stresses, zero diagonal stresses).

<p>For the interested reader, typical input files for this problem are given here:
<p>CFL3D:
<ul>
<li><a href="FlatPlate/SSGLRRRSM/cfl3d_typical.inp">Typical Input File for 2D Flat Plate</a>

</ul>

<p>The following plot shows the convergence of the wall skin friction coefficient at x=0.97008 with
grid size for the two codes.
In the plot the x-axis is plotting 1/N<sup>1/2</sup>, which is proportional to
grid spacing (h).
At the left of the plot, h=0 represents an infinitely fine grid.
As can be seen, both codes go toward approximately the same result on an infinitely refined grid.

<p>Note that in this particular flat plate case, when looking at the total integrated drag coefficient on the plate,
formal order-property convergence may not be generally achievable.  This is because the skin friction
(which is the only contributor to the drag in this case)
is singular (tends toward infinity) at the leading edge.  The finer the grid, the more nearly singular
the local behavior on a finite grid.  TAU, which is a node-centered code, solves for flow variables
at the leading edge, so it may be more sensitive to the singular behavior than CFL3D, which is a
cell-centered code.  There also appears to be some locally minor
anomalous behavior at the aft end of the plate, which is likely a function of
how each code handles the interaction of the solid wall boundary condition with the
outflow pressure boundary condition near the bottom right corner of the grid.
Nonetheless, both codes are tending toward a similar integrated drag coefficient value
as the grid is refined.

<p>The surface skin friction coefficient from both codes on the finest 545 x 385 grid
over the entire plate is shown in the next plot. Again, local anomalous behavior exists near the leading
edge (x=0) due to singular behavior of the solution,
and near the trailing edge (x=2) most likely due to boundary condition
interaction.  These behaviors differ for the two codes, and result in small local deviations that
can be seen when zoomed into the two locations. In addition, both codes indicate turbulence
"activation" at slightly different locations very near the leading edge
("activation" is where the turbulence model transitions
on its own from laminar to turbulent). But both codes are seen to yield nearly identical results
over most of the plate.

<p>Contours of the nondimensional Reynolds stress variables
(<img class="tex" alt="\hat R_{ij}" src="ssglrrrsm_eqns/img6.png" />) as well as
nondimensional omega from the two codes on the finest 545 x 385 grid are shown
in the following plots (z-scale expanded for clarity).
Results from the two codes on this grid are essentially indistinguishable.
Note legends do not necessarily reflect min and max values.
Note also that in both codes for this case, the "z"-direction is up.  Therefore, for a 2-D
computation the 12 and 23 components of the Reynolds stress are identically zero.
The results from TAU shown here are not in their native nondimensional form, but have been
re-nondimensionalized to match the native form in CFL3D.
