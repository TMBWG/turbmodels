# NACA 0012, 897x257 grid, CFL3D with SSG/LRR-RSM-w2012 model, 
# freestream k/a_inf^2=9.e-9
# freestream omega*mu_inf/(rho_inf*a_inf^2)=1.e-6
# Lifting results have point vortex farfield correction on
# (Results here given to greater accuracy than convergence tolerance)
# (Note that alpha=0 case did not converge, so those results are not reliable)
