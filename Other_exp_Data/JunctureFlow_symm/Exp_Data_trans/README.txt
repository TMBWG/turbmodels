The compressed folder “Representative Images” is divided into 3 subfolders: “Fuselage”, “Starboard Wing”, and “Port Wing” which are the 3 regions of the model where IR data were obtained. Each folder contains a sample image for each angle of incidence where natural transition was measured in that region. The filenames are of the form “(region)_(angle of incidence).png.

The compressed folder “Coordinates” is divided into 3 subfolders: “Fuselage”, “Starboard Wing”, and “Port Wing” which are the 3 regions of the model where IR data were obtained. Within the main folder is the file “Num Points.xlsx”, which specifies the number of points (independent angle-of-incidence instances) for all 3 regions that were acquired for each angle of incidence. These images were collected over the course of 12 runs that were conducted on 5 different days. Note that few angles of incidence are included in the fuselage data since boundary layer trips were added to the nose after only 3 runs. The trips at the nose were not observed to affect the transition front on the wings.

Within each subfolder is a list of .dat files containing transition front coordinates. Three .dat files are listed for each angle of incidence: max, median, and min. The filenames are of the form “(region)_(angle of incidence)_(statistic).dat. The max files contain the maximum (most downstream) x-coordinate values for each y-coordinate (wings) or z-coordinate (fuselage) value across the transition front, considering all points acquired at the specified angle of incidence. Similarly, the median and min files contain the median and minimum (most upstream) x-coordinate values, respectively. These files provide an indication of the spread of the data for each angle of incidence, and the spread is largely due to variation in the point-to-point angle of incidence (+-0.02 deg) and transition front detection. 

Another subfolder within each region subfolder is titled “Single Point”. This folder contains the coordinates from the detected transition front for angles of incidence where only a single point was acquired.

The file "TransitionByCps.dat" contains transition coordinates on the port and starboard wings for angles of incidence between -2 deg and 8 deg, inclusive, in 1-deg increments. Four streamwise-directed rows of pressure ports were considered on each wing, and the estimated transition coordinates on those rows are given for each angle of incidence.
