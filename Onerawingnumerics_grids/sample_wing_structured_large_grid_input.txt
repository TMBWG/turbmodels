! NOTE: The above parameters will generate a grid over an ONERA M6 wing.

! NOTE: Root chord will be normalized as 1.0 for any input airfoil data.

! NOTE: wing-side-change/root_le_x-shifting will be applied after
!       a grid with unit wing-root chord is generated.

! NOTE: # of elements around the wing-section is automatically set as
!          6*(Elements along the hemisphere).

! NOTE: For regular coarsening, choose the input values such that
!       (# of Elements along the the semi-wingspan) = 2^l
!     6*(# of Elements along the rounded tip)       = 2^n
!       (# of Elements in the radial direction)     = 2^m
!       where l, n, and m are integers.
