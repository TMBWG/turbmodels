# The following Cf based on Ue are the original data from the reference 
# J. Fluid Mech., Vol. 94, Part 2, 1979, pp. 209-242 (Table 2).
# They are given in terms of a "crest" and a "trough" value, reflecting spanwise variations caused by 
# longitudinal Gortler vortices along the concave wall.
# The Cf based on Uref were derived from the experimental cf_ue
# (making use of approx Ue at nearby values and Uref=31.9 m/s).
