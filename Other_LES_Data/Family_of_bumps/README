LES of family of bumps

Inlet ReTheta = 2500
Reference velocity/inlet velocity for Cf and Cp = 16.77m/s
Inlet reference theta = 0.0037m
C = 0.305m (length of bump/chord length)
Cf files have x/C vs Cf (Skin friction coefficient)
Cp files have x/C vs Cp with reference pressure being the inlet pressure (Pressure coefficient)
All tecplot files have time and span averaged Ux,Uy,P,UU,VV,WW,UV  (note: Ux=U and Uy=V velocities)
  Units: 
     Ux - m/s
     Uy - m/s
     P  - m^2/s^2 (since in OpenFOAM P/rho is computed when using incompressible)
     UU - m^2/s^2
     VV - m^2/s^2
     WW - m^2/s^2
     UV - m^2/s^2
Bump geometries have been provided in an IGES file which can be read by most meshing/CAD software. 
OpenFOAM was used for the simulations with dynamic Smagorinsky used for subgrid stresses.
