# NACA 0012, 897x257 grid, CFL3D with k-kL-MEAH2015 model, 
# freestream k/a_inf^2=9.e-9
# freestream (kL)*rho_inf/(mu_inf*a_inf)=1.5589e-6
# Lifting results have point vortex farfield correction on
# (Results here given to greater accuracy than convergence tolerance)
# (Note that alpha=0 case did not converge, so those results are not reliable)
