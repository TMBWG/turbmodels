<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: large">Relevant details for Case 2 are as follows:
</p>

<p>M_freestream = 0.10
</p>

<p>The atmospheric conditions varied, but were essentially
standard atmospheric conditions at sea level in a wind tunnel
vented to the atmosphere, in a
temperature-controlled room.  These conditions can be
given as approximately:
</p>

<p>p_ambient = approx 101325 kg/(m-s^2)
</p>
<p>T_ambient = approx 75 deg F (approx 297 K)
</p>

<p>Some derived relevant conditions are:
</p>
<p>density_ambient = approx 1.185 kg/m^3
</p>
<p>viscosity_ambient = approx 18.4e-6 kg/(m-s)
</p>
<p>u_freestream = approx 34.6 m/s
</p>
<p>Re_freestream = approx 2.23e6 per meter
</p>

<p>The upstream boundary conditions from the experiment (associated with the boundary
  layer on the plate at location x=50800 microns (50.8 mm)
  upstream of the center of the jet orifice),
  to be used to help set/verify CFD inflow BCs, are
  given in the following file:
<ul>
<li><a href="Case2_exp/UpstreamBC.dat">LV-derived Upstream BCs from experiment</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The diaphragm frequency = 150.0 Hz.
  The "neutral position" of the moveable diaphragm plate at rest inside the cavity is
  approximately 2.8 mm below the upper cavity wall (see 
  <a href="case2geometry.html">Geometry page</a> for
  details).  However, when the wind tunnel is on and when the moveable piston is
  operating, the neutral position of the plate moves up so that it is
  approximately 1.7 mm below the upper cavity wall.  <em>This change in the neutral
  position is not accounted for in the current CFD grids available from this
  website.</em>  However, it is not known whether accounting for this shift is
  important or not.  The plate then displaces sinusoidally about this new neutral 
  position with a maximum displacement of approximately +-0.77 mm.  The following
  file lists data from the cavity, including cavity pressure, voltage input,
  and displacement data about its neutral position:
<ul> 
<li><a href="Case2_exp/DriverBCrevised.dat">Driver BCs from experiment</a>, updated 
     24 December 2003</li>
</ul>
  The pressure is measured inside the cavity on its top wall, to one side of the orifice,
  approximately on the order of 10 mm from the side wall.  The pressure 
  is measured with respect to the tunnel static pressure.
</p>

<p>The following figure (updated on 24 December 2003) shows the measured 
phase-averaged streamwise and vertical velocities 
over the (approximate) center of the orifice as a function of phase.</p>

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: large">Submission Guidelines:
</p>

<p>(Last updated:  24 December 2003)</p>

<!--<p>Specific submission guidelines have not been established yet...
they will be posted here in the near future.
</p>-->

<p>Numerical predictions of this type of statistically unsteady flow are
relatively new. The purpose here is to determine the state-of-the-art in modeling
these types of unsteady synthetic-jet-type flows, so we want to explore which CFD
methods work and which do not.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li type=square>You can either model the internal cavity or specify an
        unsteady boundary condition at the orifice exit. </li>
    <li type=square>You may choose to model the moving diaphragm, or you may employ
        an unsteady boundary condition that approximates its effect
        within the cavity. </li>
  </ul>

<p>There is the requirement that you detail specifically how you choose
to model the case, including all boundary conditions and approximations made.
As we assess the methodologies used at the workshop, it will be important to
know as many details as possible about the calculations/simulations. </p>

<p>Detailed requirements include:

<p>1. The case must be run time-accurately and in three-dimensions, in order to
simulate the unsteady 3-D nature of the case.

<p>
 <ul>
   <li>1a. RANS codes run in time-accurate mode (e.g., URANS) solve directly for
phase-averaged variables, i.e. &lt;u<sub>i</sub>&gt; and 
&lt;u'<sub>i</sub>u'<sub>j</sub>&gt;.  
Click on <a href="DataSetCases_theor.pdf">link to PDF write-up</a>
for more details.
Therefore, RANS
simulations should result in repeating or very-nearly-repeating periodic
solutions.  When periodicity is achieved, averages over one or more
periods of oscillation yields the long-time-averaged (time-independent mean)
values for these quantities. </li>

   <li>1b. DNS, LES, or DES simulations will need to be post-processed to obtain both
the phase-averaged and long-time-averaged (time-independent mean) values. </li>
 </ul>

<p>2. GRID STUDY:  Solutions using more than one grid
size are encouraged, but not required.  If you use more than
one grid, submit each set of results separately.

<p>3. TIME STEP STUDY:  Solutions using more than one time step
are encouraged, but not required.  If you use more than
one time step, submit each set of results separately.

<p>Specific quantities that result from your computations
at particular locations will be required for submission.
Note that for all the following, we adopt the coordinate system
with x downstream, z up, and y spanwise, with the (x,y,z)=(0,0,0) origin
on the tunnel splitter plate 8 diameters (50.8 mm) directly upstream of
the center of the orifice (the orifice diameter is 0.25 inches = 6.35 mm).
The requirements follow (if you are unable to provide a particular
quantity, simply leave it out of the "variable" list, and reduce
the number of columns of data submitted):
</p>

<p>
<pre>
a. Long-time-averaged downstream velocity (u), spanwise velocity (v), and
vertical velocity (w) profiles (nondimensionalized by Uinf) along
vertical lines at the centerplane (y=0) and: x=0 mm, x=44.45 mm (-1D upstream),
x=50.8 mm (center of orifice),
x=57.15 mm (1D downstream), x=63.5 mm (2D downstream), x=76.2 mm (4D downstream),
and x=101.6 mm (8D downstream).  Give these data to at least a height of 50 mm.
Also, submit horizontal lines of results at
x=57.15 mm and: z=5 mm, z=10 mm, and z=20 mm; and also at
x=63.5 mm and: z=5 mm, z=10 mm, and z=20 mm.  Give these data to at least a
width of 25 mm to either side of the orifice.  Also, submit horizontal
lines of results at y=0, z=0.4 mm over the slot (from approx x=47.625 mm to
x=53.975 mm), and at y=0, z=10 mm from at least x=45 mm to x=70 mm.

c.  Phase-averaged time-history values of &lt;u&gt;, &lt;v&gt;, and &lt;w&gt;
(nondimensionalized by Uinf) as a
function of phase (deg) at three approximate point locations:
(x,y,z)=(50.63, 0, 0.40)mm, (57.15, 0, 10)mm, and
(63.5, 0, 10)mm.  Give the data at
every time step taken.  In other words, if your time step yields
100 steps per cycle, then give 100 phases between 0 deg and 360 deg.
You should align the phases of your computation as described below.

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">Definition of Phase for the Computations (modified 24 December 2003)</p>

<p>Matching the same phases with the experiment is not necessarily straightforward.
One way to do it is to try to align a quantity from
experiment (such as vertical velocity near the jet exit), but this
can be imprecise because the CFD and experimental data are not necessarily
well-behaved sine-waves.  The best criteria for determining
phase may in fact be a different measure altogether.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in this workshop we want to be able to compare CFD results
with each other, so it is important to try to achieve the same
phase definitions in order that all computations are similarly aligned.
We have tried to choose criteria for determining phase that
approximates experiment AND is specific enough so that different
CFD solutions can be meaningfully compared.</p>

<p>Therefore, although participants are given some latitude to determine
phase as appropriate, we encourage everyone to use the following steps
to define phase in a uniform fashion for Case 2:</p>

<p>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Step 1</strong>.  Output vertical phase-averaged velocity (w) at the following point in space
(over the orifice) as a function of your iteration or time step number:
(x,y,z)=(50.63, 0, 0.40)mm.  Find wmax and wmin over the course of one
phase-averaged period.</li>
   <li><strong>Step 2</strong>.  Compute the mid-value <strong>wavg</strong>=(wmax+wmin)/2</li>
   <li><strong>Step 3</strong>.  Define Phase=50 deg as the time when your velocity at this location
approximately equals <strong>wavg</strong> (INCREASING).  All other phases can be referenced
from this, via the following relation:</li>
   <p><dd>Phase=(iter-it50)*360/nstep+50</dd></p>
<p>where:</p>
   <dd>iter =iteration (or time step) number</dd>
   <dd>nstep=no. of time steps per cycle</dd>
   <dd>it50=iteration number when Phase=50 according to the above criteria</dd>
 </ul>
</p>

<p>For example, if you are running 360 steps per cycle and
you match the above criteria at time step number 5492, then</p>
  <dd>Phase=iter-5442</dd>
<p>Thus, when iter=5442, then Phase=0; when iter=5622, then Phase=180;
when iter=5802, then Phase=360.  Note that Phase=360 also corresponds
with Phase=0 (it repeats every 360 deg). This is illustrated
in the following figure (updated on 24 December 2003):</p>
     <table width="675" border="0">
     <center>
       <tr align="center" valign="bottom">
        <p><img
src="Case2_sample/phaseexample2.jpg" height="674" border="3"
     title="plot showing how to determine phase" alt="plot showing how to determine phase"></p>
       </tr>
     </center>
     </table>

<p>As another example, say you are running 1080 steps per cycle and
you match the above criteria at time step number 10002, then</p>
  <dd>Phase=(iter-10002)/3+50</dd>
<p>Thus, when iter=9852, then Phase=0; when iter=10392, then Phase=180;
when iter=10932, then Phase=360.</p>
