Chris,
I have attached the dataset for the wingtip vortex experiment. It was chosen as a Flomania CFD validation case and I went through the paperwork (i.e. NASA 1676 form) at that time and so it is freely available for distribution.  It can be posted to the turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov website because it is already in the public domain. Please add a "p" to the filename and unzip (note that "p" was removed from the filename to get past e-mail filters). There are a few README files included that explain the data format. Below is a list of publications related to the dataset that were written by people directly involved in the project (others have used the data and published but I don't have an up-to-date comprehensive list). Reference 4 below (NASA TM 110418) is Jim Chow's PhD thesis and it is available on the NASA Technical Reports server as a scanned PDF.  Please let me know if you need anything else. Can you send me a message to confirm that you have received the data? Thanks, Greg Zilliac
