This grouping contains all the incompressible-flow cases from
the 1980-81 Data Library, EXCEPT for four very long cases,
0411 (Cantwell cylinder), 0441 (Wadcock airfoil), 0511
(Shabaka wing-body junction), 0512 (Humphrey bend).

The data on the original files are in normalized format, as
explained on p. 60 of the 1980-81 Proceedings. Later disks
contain "unpacked" versions of some of the cases (those
actually used in the project on Collaborative Testing of
Turbulence Models) with an "A" appended to the original case
number.

The 1980-81 Conference Proceedings give a full description
of the cases.
