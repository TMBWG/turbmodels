Update as of 7/29/2014
Explanation of terms in the DNS data files:

Unless otherwise stated, all variables are normalized by the initial channel
half-width delta(0) and initial friction velocity u_tau(0).  The initial
conditions are based on the unstrained channel flow.
(Data posted prior to 6/11/2014 were nondimensionalized differently:
by initial channel half-width delta(0) and reference velocity Uref=26.330*utau(0).)
Note that in the header section in each data file the variable 
u_tau provided is utau(t)/Uref.

From the unstrained data, Re_tau(0) = RE*(u_tau(0)/u_ref)=391.68274815

Changes between revisions:

Changes between 6/11/2014 and 7/29/2014:
1. Pressure statistics were previously incorrect in all files (bug).
2. Minor differences in the unstrained data due to previous use of lower number of digits of accuracy in utau0 (used for non-dimensionalizing all quantities).
3. Minor differences in rms_p in unstrained data, due to revised method now consistent with how it was done for strained data.

Changes between 5/19/2014 and 6/11/2014:
1. New data nondimensionalized by u_tau(0) rather than Uref=26.330*utau(0).
