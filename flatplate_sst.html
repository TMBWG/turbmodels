<p><strong><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 700; font-size: x-large">SST-Vm Expected Results - 2D Zero
Pressure Gradient Flat Plate</strong>

<p>Previously on this page the results were reported as SST-V solutions, but more properly they
should be referred to as SST-Vm.
<p>Note that although particular 
<a href="sst.html#sst-v">SST-Vm</a> results are described in detail here,
results using the <a href="sst.html#sst-v">SST-V</a> and
<a href="sst.html#sst-std">SST</a> model version are nearly identical for this flat plate case.

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">Results are shown here from 2 compressible codes
so that the user may compare their own compressible code results.  Multiple grids were
used so the user can see trends with grid refinement.  Different codes will behave
differently with grid refinement depending on many factors (including code order of accuracy
and other numerics),
but it would be expected that as the grid is refined the results
will tend toward an "infinite grid" solution that is the same.
Be careful when comparing details: any differences in boundary conditions or flow conditions
may affect results.

<p>Two independent compressible RANS codes,
CFL3D and FUN3D, were used to compute this
zero-pressure-gradient flat plate flow with the Menter shear stress transport model
(version <span style="color: blue">SST-Vm</span> - see full description on
<a href="sst.html">Menter Shear Stress Transport page</a>). The full series of 5 grids were used.
CFL3D is a cell-centered structured-grid code, and FUN3D
is a node-centered unstructured-grid code (FUN3D can solve on mixed element grids, so this case
was computed on the same hexahedral grid used by CFL3D).  Both codes used Roe's Flux Difference
Splitting and a UMUSCL upwind approach.  In CFL3D its standard UMUSCL (kappa=0.33333) scheme was
used, whereas in FUN3D the option UMUSCL 0.5 was used.  Both codes were run with
full Navier-Stokes (as opposed to thin-layer, which is CFL3D's default mode of operation),
and both codes used first-order upwinding for the advective terms of the turbulence model.
Details about the codes can be found on their respective websites,
the links for which are given on this site's 
<a href="index.html">home page</a>.
The codes were not run to machine-zero iterative convergence, but an attempt was made to converge
sufficiently so that results of interest were well within normal engineering tolerance and
plotting accuracy.  For example, for CFL3D the density residual was typically
driven down below 10<sup>-13</sup>.  It should be kept in mind that many of the files given below
contain computed values directly from the codes,
using a precision <strong>greater</strong> than the convergence tolerance (i.e., the values
in the files are not necessarily as precise as the number of digits given).

<p>Note that in the SST-Vm model, in the production
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="P = \mu_t \Omega^2 - \frac{2}{3}\rho k \delta_{ij} \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}"
  src="sstvort_eqns/img2.png" /></dd>
</dl>
the second term is not included.  For this particular low-speed flow, the effect of this second term
is negligible, so SST-V and SST-Vm results are essentially the same.
(Previously on this page the results were reported as SST-V solutions, but more properly they should be referred
to as SST-Vm.)

<p>For the CFL3D and FUN3D tests reported below, the turbulent inflow boundary conditions used for SST-Vm
were the following:
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="k_{farfield} = 9 \times 10^{-9} a_{\infty}^2 \left(here = 1.125 \frac{U_{\infty}^2}{Re_L} \right)"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img2.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="\omega_{farfield} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\rho_{\infty}a_{\infty}^2}{\mu_{\infty}} \left(here =
  125 \frac{U_{\infty}}{L} \right)"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img4.png" /></dd>
</dl>
where the second equality (in parentheses) is shown solely for the purpose of relating the farfield BCs in CFL3D and
FUN3D to the nondimensionalizations used in the
<a href="sst.html">original SST reference</a>.  This relation applies for the current problem only (M=0.2, Re=5 million).  
This is because (for example) the <i>k</i> in CFL3D and FUN3D is a nondimensional
quantity (k' = k/ainf<sup>2</sup>), which is by default set to 9.e-9 in the freestream.
Furthermore, Re<sub>L</sub>, which in the context of the 
<a href="sst.html">original SST reference</a>
is supposed to relate to the "approximate length of the computational
domain," is taken here as
<img class="tex" alt="Re_L = 5 \times 10^6"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img3.png" />.

<p>The above two equations represent the "standard" SST-Vm boundary condition
values used by both CFL3D and FUN3D, chosen to achieve
a not-too-low level of freestream
turbulent kinetic energy, a not-too-severe rate of freestream turbulence decay,
and a reasonable level of freestream turbulent eddy viscosity of
<img class="tex" alt="\mu_t/\mu_{\infty} = 0.009"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img7.png" />. 
Although these levels are different from the range quoted in the 
<a href="sst.html">original SST reference</a>,
tests were also done with the following levels that fall within the original SST author's recommended range:
<img class="tex" alt="k_{farfield} = 4 \times 10^{-10} a_{\infty}^2 \left(here = 0.05 U_{\infty}^2/Re_L \right)"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img5.png" />, and
<img class="tex" alt="\omega_{farfield} = 4 \times 10^{-8} \rho_{\infty}a_{\infty}^2/\mu_{\infty} \left(here =
  5 U_{\infty}/L \right)"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img6.png" />. The resulting freestream turbulent eddy viscosity ends up
about the same:
<img class="tex" alt="\mu_t/\mu_{\infty} = 0.01"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img8.png" />.
Computed results were almost identical (for example, both 
C<sub>f</sub> in the middle of the plate and total C<sub>D</sub> differed by well less than 
one percent).  See further discussion near the bottom of the page (below) on influence of freestream
turbulence levels for this case.

</ul>

<p>All FUN3D results below are from the original run (rev 32421).

<p>Note: prior to April 2, 2010, the drag coefficient numbers posted on this page were scaled too high by a
factor of 2, because an incorrect reference area (of 1 instead of 2) was used. This has been corrected here.

<p>The following plot shows the convergence of the wall skin friction coefficient at x=0.97008 with
grid size for the two codes.
In the plot the x-axis is plotting 1/N<sup>1/2</sup>, which is proportional to
grid spacing (h).
At the left of the plot, h=0 represents an infinitely fine grid.
As can be seen, both codes go toward approximately the same result on an infinitely refined grid.

<a href="FlatPlate/SST/cf_convergence_sstv.dat">cf_convergence_sstv.dat</a>.

<p>Note that in this particular flat plate case, when looking at the total integrated drag coefficient on the plate,
formal order-property convergence may not be generally achievable.  This is because the skin friction
(which is the only contributor to the drag in this case)
is singular (tends toward infinity) at the leading edge.  The finer the grid, the more nearly singular
the local behavior on a finite grid.  FUN3D, which is a node-centered code, solves for flow variables
at the leading edge, so it may be more sensitive to the singular behavior than CFL3D, which is a
cell-centered code.  There also appears to be some locally minor
anomalous behavior at the aft end of the plate, which is likely a function of
how each code handles the interaction of the solid wall boundary condition with the
outflow pressure boundary condition near the bottom right corner of the grid.
Nonetheless, both codes are tending toward a similar integrated drag coefficient value
as the grid is refined.

<p>The surface skin friction coefficient from both codes on the finest 545 x 385 grid
over the entire plate is shown in the next plot. Again, local anomalous behavior exists near the leading
edge (x=0) due to singular behavior of the solution,
and near the trailing edge (x=2) most likely due to boundary condition
interaction.  These behaviors differ for the two codes, and result in small local deviations that
can be seen when zoomed into the two locations. In addition, both codes indicate turbulence
"activation" at slightly different locations very near the leading edge, 0 &lt; x &lt; 0.01
("activation" is where the turbulence model transitions
on its own from laminar to turbulent). But both codes are seen to yield nearly identical results
over most of the plate.

<p>Notice that the nondimensional eddy viscosity above has a small "bump" near y=0.01 in the above plot.
The same behavior occurs for both CFL3D and FUN3D on the finest grid.
This behavior is due to the SST blending between omega and vorticity
in the denominator of the equation for eddy viscosity, and is only
noticeable on extremely fine grids for this flat plate case.
The bump is located in the region where the SST F1 and F2 functions are in the
process of transitioning from 1 to 0, as shown in

<p>Recall that all results above (and elsewhere on this website) are from compressible CFD codes.  
To give an indication of the magnitude of the difference between compressible (M=0.2) and incompressible results 
using SST/SST-V/SST-Vm
for this case, sample skin friction convergence at x=0.97 using different compressible/incompressible codes are plotted below:

<p>Below, the influence of a variety of different freestream turbulence conditions on the M=0.2 case 
using SST/SST-V/SST-Vm is described.
Recall that the turbulent inflow boundary conditions used in CFL3D and FUN3D for all the results given above are:
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="k_{farfield} = 9 \times 10^{-9} a_{\infty}^2 \left(here = 1.125 \frac{U_{\infty}^2}{Re_L} \right)"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img2.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="\omega_{farfield} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\rho_{\infty}a_{\infty}^2}{\mu_{\infty}} \left(here =
  125 \frac{U_{\infty}}{L} \right)"
  src="flatplate_sst_eqns/img4.png" /></dd>
</dl>
where the second equality in each equation is valid for the current problem only (M=0.2, Re=5 million).
For this case these correspond to freestream turbulence intensity=0.039% and freestream turbulent viscosity (relative to laminar)=0.009.
Other freestream levels were tested on the 273 x 193 grid in CFL3D, as tabulated here:

<p>The bottom line is that, within a "reasonable range," the 
freestream turbulence levels made very little difference in the solution for this case (less
than 0.1% for all cases tested).  For
fully turbulent solutions, the levels must be
sufficient to allow the model to activate turbulence early on the plate, but must not be
so unphysical as to corrupt the turbulent solutions (see discussion in
note 5 on <a href="noteonrunning.html">Notes on running CFD</a> page).
