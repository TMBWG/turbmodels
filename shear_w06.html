<p><strong><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 700; font-size: x-large">Wilcox2006-klim-m Expected Results - 2D Coflowing Jet</strong>

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">
Previously on this page the results were reported as Wilcox2006-klim solutions, but more properly they should be
referred to as Wilcox2006-klim-m.

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">Results are shown here from 2 compressible codes
so that the user may compare their own compressible code results.  Multiple grids were
used so the user can see trends with grid refinement.  Different codes will behave
differently with grid refinement depending on many factors (including code order of accuracy
and other numerics),
but it would be expected that as the grid is refined the results
will tend toward an "infinite grid" solution that is the same.
Be careful when comparing details: any differences in boundary conditions or flow conditions
may affect results.

<p>Note that this case was previously referred to as a 2D Planar Shear, but it is
more appropriately referred to as a 2D Coflowing Jet.  Some of the figures associated with this
case may still have the word "shear" in them.

<p>Two independent compressible RANS codes,
CFL3D and FUN3D, were used to compute this
coflowing jet flow with the Wilcox2006-klim-m model
(see full description on
<a href="wilcox.html">Wilcox k-omega page</a>). The full series of 5 grids were used.
CFL3D is a cell-centered structured-grid code, and FUN3D
is a node-centered unstructured-grid code (FUN3D can solve on mixed element grids, so this case
was computed on the same hexahedral grid used by CFL3D).  Both codes used Roe's Flux Difference
Splitting and a UMUSCL upwind approach.  In CFL3D its standard UMUSCL (kappa=0.33333) scheme was
used, whereas in FUN3D the option UMUSCL 0.5 was used.  Both codes were run with
full Navier-Stokes (as opposed to thin-layer, which is CFL3D's default mode of operation),
and both codes used first-order upwinding for the advective terms of the turbulence model.
Details about the codes can be found on their respective websites,
the links for which are given on this site's 
<a href="index.html">home page</a>.
The codes were not run to machine-zero iterative convergence, but an attempt was made to converge
sufficiently so that results of interest were well within normal engineering tolerance and
plotting accuracy.  For example, for CFL3D the density residual was typically
driven down below 10<sup>-11</sup>.  It should be kept in mind that many of the files given below
contain computed values directly from the codes,
using a precision <strong>greater</strong> than the convergence tolerance (i.e., the values
in the files are not necessarily as precise as the number of digits given).

<p>Note that in both CFL3D and FUN3D, the production term
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="P = \tau_{ij}\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}"
  src="bump_sst_eqns/img5.png" /></dd>
</dl>
is approximated by
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="P = 2 \mu_t S_{ij}S_{ij}"
  src="bump_sst_eqns/img6.png" /></dd>
</dl>which is exact for incompressible flow.  For this particular low-speed flow, the approximation is
very accurate.
(Previously on this page the results were reported as Wilcox2006-klim solutions, but more properly they should be referred
to as Wilcox2006-klim-m because of this approximation and the fact that the
<img class="tex" alt="(2/3) \overline \rho k \delta_{ij}" src="implementrans_eqns/img27.png" />
term is ignored in tau_ij in the momentum and energy equations.)

<p>For the CFL3D and FUN3D tests reported below, the turbulent inflow boundary conditions used for Wilcox2006-klim-m
were the following:
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="k_{farfield} = 9 \times 10^{-9} a_{\infty}^2"
  src="bump_sst_eqns/img2.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class="tex" alt="\omega_{farfield} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\rho_{\infty}a_{\infty}^2}{\mu_{\infty}}"
  src="bump_sst_eqns/img3.png" /></dd>
</dl>

<p>The above two equations represent the "standard" Wilcox2006-klim-m boundary condition
values used by both CFL3D and FUN3D, chosen to achieve
a not-too-low level of freestream
turbulent kinetic energy, a not-too-severe rate of freestream turbulence decay,
and a reasonable level of freestream turbulent eddy viscosity of
<img class="tex" alt="\mu_t/\mu_{\infty} = 0.009"
  src="bump_sst_eqns/img4.png" />.

<p>The following plot shows the convergence of the drag coefficient due to
skin friction on both sides of the thin plate between -10 &lt; x &lt; 0
with grid size for the two codes.
In the plot the x-axis is plotting 1/N<sup>1/2</sup>, which is proportional to
grid spacing (h).
At the left of the plot, h=0 represents an infinitely fine grid.
Both codes go toward approximately the same result on an infinitely refined grid.

sound) at 3 different locations in the jet: (1) x=2.71623, (2) x=29.2468, and
(3) x=95.501.
As seen, both codes are tending toward similar results
as the grid is refined.

<p>This type of flow exhibits self-similar behavior far enough downstream.
The velocity can be normalized as (u-u<sub>1</sub>)/(u<sub>m</sub>-u<sub>1</sub>),
where u<sub>1</sub> is the velocity at the edge of the outer stream, and
u<sub>m</sub> is the peak (centerline) velocity.  When plotted against y/b,
where b is the halfwidth (location where u-u<sub>1</sub> is half of
u<sub>m</sub>-u<sub>1</sub>), the results can be compared
to the experimental data of Bradbury and Riley (J. Fluid Mech
27(2):381-394, 1967,

In the following plot, CFL3D results are taken from the
three x-locations x=29.2468, x=64.2188, and x=95.501.  The CFD results are approximately
self-similar and agree well with the experiment.
