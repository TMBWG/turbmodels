 1. FLOW TITLE: CASE 8501;  "COMPRESSIBILITY EFFECTS ON FREE SHEAR LAYERS"

 2. REVISION DATE: NOVEMBER 15, 1980

 3. EVALUATOR: BRADSHAW, P., IMPERIAL COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY,
    LONDON, ENGLAND

 4. EXPERIMENT LOCATION AND DATE: VARIOUS

 5. ABSTRACT: TEST CASE CONSISTS OF DATA OF SPREADING RATE WITH
    MACH NUMBER.  OTHER THAN THE DATA FOR MACH 19 TAKEN FROM
    REF. 2, NEW DATA ARE NOT STRONG EVIDENCE FOR MODIFYING THE
    DATA FROM REF. 1 .

    SINCE THE OBJECT IS TO PREDICT THE ASYMPTOTIC SPREADING RATE
    AFTER THE EFFECT OF INITIAL CONDITION HAS DISAPPEARED, THE
    INITIAL PROFILES SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY THE COMPUTER AS THE BEST
    GUESS AT THE ASYMPTOTIC PREDICTIONS OF HIS METHOD.  ROUGHLY,
    THE VELOCITY PROFILE IS AN ERROR FUNCTION WITH A STANDARD
    DEVIATION OF 1.3/(DELTA/X), AND IS PROPORTIONAL TO EXP(-Y**2),
    THE CONSTANT OF PROPORTIONALITY BEING ABOUT 0.01*UE**2 WHEN
    DELTA/X = 0.115.  AT HIGH MACH NUMBER, DENSITY VARIATIONS HAVE
    AN ILL DOCUMENTED EFFECT ON THE SHEAR STRESS PROFILE.  NOTE
    THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE ERROR FUNCTION PROFILE IS AT THE POINT
    AT WHICH U/UE = 0.5, WHICH IS NOT THE LINE ETA = 0 .  AT LOW
    SPEEDS, U/UE = 0.5 ON ETA = Y/X = 0.04 APPROXIMATELY.

    OF A FREE TURBULENT SHEAR FLOW AT MACH 19 WITH ELECTRON BEAM AND
    CONVENTIONAL PROBES"  NASA TN D-7981, 1975

 7. INSTRUMENTATION:
    MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE USING VARIOUS TECHNIQUES INCLUDING
    ELECTRON BEAM, CONVENTIONAL PITOT TUBE AND TOTAL TEMPERATURE
    PROBE TECHNIQUES.

 8. EXPERIMENTAL PARAMETERS:
    MACH NUMBER (XM) : .......................  0 < M < 5 AND M = 19
    SPREADING RATE PARAMETER AT XM = 0 (SIGMA 0) : .....  11.1
    VELOCITY RATIO U2/U1 : ..............................  0.0

 9. MEASURED VARIABLES:
    MEASURED VARIABLES INCLUDE MACH NUMBER, VELOCITY, TOTAL
    PRESSURE AND TOTAL TEMPERATURE.

    THE DATA ARE REPORTED AS A TABLE OF VALUES OF (SIGMA / SIGMA 0)
    CONVERTED TO DELTA/X CORRESPONDING TO VALUES OF THE MACH NUMBER.
    SIGMA IS THE SPREADING RATE PARAMETER (INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO
    THICKNESS) AND DELTA DEFINES THE THICKNESS FOR U/UE 0.316 TO 0.949

10. UNCERTAINTY:
    BIRCH, S. F., ESTIMATES THE ERROR BAND AS + OR - 5 PERCENT AT LOW
    SPEEDS INCREASING TO + OR - 10 PERCENT AT XM = 5.  ERROR AT
    XM = 19 IS INDICATED BY THE TWO VALUES.

11. TAPE ORGANIZATION: THE TAPE IS A 2400 FOOT, 9 TRACK, ODD PARITY,
    PHASE ENCODED UNLABELLED TAPE WRITTEN AT A DENSITY OF 1600 BITS PER
    INCH ACCORDING TO EBCDIC CODE.  THE RECORD FORMAT IS FIXED AND
    BLOCKED; RECORD LENGTH = 80 BYTES; BLOCKSIZE = 8000 BYTES

    NORMALIZED DATA ARE CREATED FROM MEASURED DATA AS FOLLOWS:
    XNORM = (X - XMIN)/(XMAX - XMIN)
    NORMALIZED VALUES ARE INTEGERIZED BY MULTIPLYING BY 10000 AND
    ROUNDING UP OR DOWN TO THE NEAREST INTEGER.
    IXNORM = XNORM * 10000.
    THUS EACH NORMALIZED DATUM IS WRITTEN ONTO TAPE AS AN INTEGER
    VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 10000.
    ALL NULL DATA ARE WRITTEN AS 20000
    THE EQUATION DESCRIBING THE RELATION BETWEEN ACTUAL DATA AND
    THE NORMALIZED DATA ON TAPE ARE
    X = XMIN + (((XMAX - XMIN) * IXNORM)/10000.)
    WHERE X, XMAX AND XMIN ARE REAL AND IXNORM IS INTEGER.
