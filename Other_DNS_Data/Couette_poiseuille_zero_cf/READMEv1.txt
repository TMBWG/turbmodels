These DNS data are from Coleman, Pirozzoli, Quadrio & Spalart (CPQS): "Direct numerical simulation and theory 
of a wall-bounded flow with zero skin friction", Flow Turbulence Combust., 2017, 99, 553--564.

The "Case C" data are provided (see Table 1 of CPQS), in Tecplot format.

All variables are normalized with respect to wall velocity Uw (applied to BOTH walls; see CPQS) and half-height h of channel.
