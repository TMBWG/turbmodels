<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: large">Relevant details for Case 1 are as follows:
</p>
<p>Flow issues into an enclosed box (24 inches on each side).
</p>

<p>M_freestream = 0
</p>

<p>The atmospheric conditions varied, but were essentially
standard atmospheric conditions at sea level, in a
temperature-controlled room.  These conditions can be
given as approximately:
</p>

<p>p_ambient = approx 101325 kg/(m-s^2)
</p>
<p>T_ambient inside box = approx 75 deg F (approx 297 K)
</p>
<p>T inside cavity = approx 83 deg F (approx 301 K)
</p>

<p>Some derived relevant conditions are:
</p>
<p>density_ambient = approx 1.185 kg/m^3
</p>
<p>viscosity_ambient = approx 18.4e-6 kg/(m-s)
</p>

<p>The diaphragm frequency = 444.7 Hz.
  The 2.0 inch-diameter diaphragm is circular, and is held in place with an o-ring
  seal 1.5 inches in diameter.
  The displacement (D) at the center of the diaphragm as a
  function of phase is given in the following file:
<ul>
<li><a href="Case1_exp/BC.dat">BCs from PIV experiment</a>, updated 22 August 2003</li>
</ul>
  Note that the displacement at the center of the diaphragm
  is offset - it displaces inward LESS and outward MORE
  (i.e., the reference position is not zero)
  Also in the file, the pressure (P) and temperature (T) as a
  function of phase are given.  The location where these
  quantities are measured are as follows.  The pressure
  is measured inside the cavity on the wall opposite the
  center of the diaphragm (the pressure is given
  with respect to an unspecified reference pressure, which may
  be presumed to be approximately atmospheric).
  The temperature is measured at the bottom (floor)
  of the cavity.  (The voltage input to the diaphragm, prior to
  being amplified, is also included in the file,
  although this is not relevant information for CFD.  It has
  been offset to positive values for LDV purposes.)
</p>

<p> The following image shows a view of the cavity assembly from the underside.  The diaphragm
is on the right side (next to the displacement gauge).  The image shows the location
of the pressure gauge (mounted onto the side wall of the chamber opposite the center of the
diaphragm), as well as the location of the thermocouple (at the bottom wall of the chamber).

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: large">Submission Guidelines:
</p>

<p>(Last updated:  16 October 2003)</p>

<!--<p>Specific submission guidelines have not been established yet...
they will be posted here in the near future.
</p> -->

<p>Numerical predictions of this type of statistically unsteady flow are
relatively new. The purpose here is to determine the state-of-the-art in modeling
these types of unsteady synthetic-jet-type flows, so we want to explore which CFD
methods work and which do not.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li type=square>You can either model the internal cavity or specify an
        unsteady boundary condition at the slot exit. </li>
    <li type=square>You may choose to model the moving diaphragm, or you may employ
        an unsteady boundary condition that approximates its effect
        within the cavity.  </li>
    <li type=square>Even though the geometry (and flowfield)
        is inherently three-dimensional, you
        may choose to model it two-dimensionally (across the center
        of the slot).  </li>
  </ul>

<p>There is the requirement that you detail specifically how you choose
to model the case, including all boundary conditions and approximations made.
As we assess the methodologies used at the workshop, it will be important to
know as many details as possible about the calculations/simulations. </p>

<p>Detailed requirements include:

<p>1. The case must be run time-accurately, in order to simulate the unsteady
nature of the case.

<p>
 <ul>
   <li>1a. RANS codes run in time-accurate mode (e.g., URANS) solve directly for
phase-averaged variables, i.e. &lt;u<sub>i</sub>&gt; and 
&lt;u'<sub>i</sub>u'<sub>j</sub>&gt;.  
Click on <a href="DataSetCases_theor.pdf">link to PDF write-up</a>
for more details.
Therefore, RANS
simulations should result in repeating or very-nearly-repeating periodic
solutions.  When periodicity is achieved, averages over one or more
periods of oscillation yields the long-time-averaged (time-independent mean)
values for these quantities. </li>

   <li>1b. DNS, LES, or DES simulations will need to be post-processed to obtain both
the phase-averaged and long-time-averaged (time-independent mean) values. </li>
 </ul>

<p>2. GRID STUDY:  If you choose to model this case two-dimensionally, then it is
<em>strongly suggested</em> that you perform the computation using at least two
different grid sizes in order to assess the effect of spatial
discretization error on the solution.  If you model it
three-dimensionally, then solutions using more than one grid
size are encouraged, but not required.  If you use more than
one grid, submit each set of results separately.

<p>3. TIME STEP STUDY:  If you choose to model this case two-dimensionally, then it is
<em>strongly suggested</em> that you perform the computation using at least two
different time step sizes in order to assess the effect of temporal
discretization error on the solution.  If you model it
three-dimensionally, then solutions using more than one time step
are encouraged, but not required.  If you use more than
one time step, submit each set of results separately.

<p>Specific quantities that result from your computations
at particular locations will be required for submission.
Note that for all the following, we adopt the coordinate system
with x across the slot (across the 0.05 inch-wide gap)
and y up, with the (x,y)=(0,0) origin
at the bottom wall of the "box" into which the jet issues,
at the center of the slot opening.  All results from 3-D
computations are to be given at the z=0 location (across the center
of the slot).  The requirements follow (if you 
are unable to provide a particular
quantity, simply leave it out of the "variable" list, and reduce
the number of columns of data submitted):
</p>

<p>
<pre>
a. Long-time-averaged jet width (width is in the x-direction)
as a function of vertical height above
the lower wall, from the wall up to a height of at least 20 mm.
Define jet width as the horizontal distance
between which the vertical velocity exceeds its (maximum+minimum)/2
value (at that vertical height).

e.  Field line-contour-plots (in one of the following formats: ps, eps, or jpg)
of phase-averaged &lt;u&gt;-velocity and &lt;v&gt;-velocity at the following phases:
45 deg, 90 deg, 135 deg, and 225 deg.; where you should align the phases of
your computation as described below.  These
plots should be black-and-white line plots only.
The plots should go from approx x=-3mm to 3 mm, and y=0mm
to y=8mm.  The x-to-y ratio of the plot should be 1.0.  For
all plot files, plot line contours of -20 m/s through 30 m/s in increments of
1 m/s.  Either (a) plot the lines of negative velocity as dashed lines
and the lines of positive velocity as solid lines, or (b) label the
contour lines, or (c) do both.  The purpose of submitting these plots is to get
a qualitative picture of the phase-averaged flowfield at
particular selected times of interest.  Altogether, submit 8 plots files.
   Name these files: case1.phase045.u.ANYTHING.eps
                     case1.phase090.u.ANYTHING.eps
                     case1.phase135.u.ANYTHING.eps
                     case1.phase225.u.ANYTHING.eps

                     case1.phase225.v.ANYTHING.eps
(where the "eps" in this case means encapsulated postscript - use ps,
or jpg instead if appropriate).

<p><span style="text-align: left; font-weight: 400; font-size: medium">Definition of Phase for the Computations, updated 20 October 2003</p>

<p>Matching the same phases with the experiment is not necessarily straightforward.
One way to do it is to try to align a quantity from
experiment (such as vertical velocity near the jet exit), but this
can be imprecise because the CFD and experimental data are not necessarily
well-behaved sine-waves.  The best criteria for determining
phase may in fact be a different measure altogether.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in this workshop we want to be able to compare CFD results
with each other, so it is important to try to achieve the same
phase definitions in order that all computations are similarly aligned.
We have tried to choose criteria for determining phase that
approximates experiment AND is specific enough so that different
CFD solutions can be meaningfully compared.</p>

<p>Therefore, although participants are given some latitude to determine
phase as appropriate, we encourage everyone to use the following steps
to define phase in a uniform fashion for Case 1:</p>

<p>
 <ul>
   <li><strong>Step 1</strong>.  Output vertical phase-averaged velocity (v) at the following point in space
(over the slot) as a function of your iteration or time step number:
(x,y,z)=(0, 0.1, 0)mm.  Find vmax and vmin over the course of one
phase-averaged period.</li>
   <li><strong>Step 2</strong>.  Compute the mid-value <strong>vavg</strong>=(vmax+vmin)/2</li>
   <li><strong>Step 3</strong>.  Define Phase=340 deg as the time when your velocity at this location
approximately equals <strong>vavg</strong> (INCREASING).  All other phases can be referenced
from this, via the following relation:</li>
   <p><dd>Phase=(iter-it340)*360/nstep+340</dd></p>
<p>where:</p>
   <dd>iter =iteration (or time step) number</dd>
   <dd>nstep=no. of time steps per cycle</dd>
   <dd>it340=iteration number when Phase=340 according to the above criteria</dd>
 </ul>
</p>

<p>For example, if you are running 360 steps per cycle and
you match the above criteria at time step number 5575, then</p>
  <dd>Phase=iter-5235</dd>
<p>Thus, when iter=5235, then Phase=0; when iter=5415, then Phase=180;
when iter=5595, then Phase=360.  Note that Phase=360 also corresponds
with Phase=0 (it repeats every 360 deg). This is illustrated
in the following figure:</p>
     <table width="675" border="0">
     <center>
       <tr align="center" valign="bottom">
        <p><img
src="Case1_sample/phaseexample1.jpg" height="674" border="3"
     title="plot showing how to determine phase" alt="plot showing how to determine phase"></p>
       </tr>
     </center>
     </table>

<p>As another example, say you are running 1080 steps per cycle and
you match the above criteria at time step number 10002, then</p>
  <dd>Phase=(iter-10002)/3+340</dd>
<p>Thus, when iter=8982, then Phase=0; when iter=9522, then Phase=180;
when iter=10062, then Phase=360.</p>
